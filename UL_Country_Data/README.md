# Objective
HELP International, an NGO dedicated to fighting poverty and providing humanitarian relief, needs to decide how to best use their funds. With $10 million available, the CEO must identify the countries that are most in need. Our job is to use unsupervised learning techniques on socio-economic and health data to cluster countries by their level of development, ultimately highlighting those that require the most aid.

# Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data), contains various socio-economic and health indicators for multiple countries. The goal of this dataset is to capture diverse attributes that reflect a country's overall development.
